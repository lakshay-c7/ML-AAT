1. creating the directory in python
  
   !mkdir diabetes
  
   - Creates a directory named "diabetes". This step might be intended to organize files, although it is not used further in the provided code.

2. here librariers have been imported
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   
   - Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning.

3. data that has to be loaded
   data = pd.read_csv("/content/diabetes/diabetes.csv")
   data
   
   - Loads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and displays it.

4.  target have been seperated from the features
   x = data.drop(['Outcome'], axis=1)
   x.head()
   y = data['Outcome']
   y
   
   - Separates the features (independent variables) from the target variable (Outcome). The target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

5. Scale Features:
   
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   x = scaler.fit_transform(x)
   x
   
  
   - Uses MinMaxScaler to scale the feature values between 0 and 1. This is important for KNN as it is sensitive to the scale of the data.

6. Split Data:
  
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)
   
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, with 70% for training and 30% for testing. The `random_state=1` ensures reproducibility.

7. Train Initial KNN Model:
   
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

   knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
   knn.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
   ypred = knn.predict(xtest)
   ypred
   ytest
  
   - Trains a KNN model with `k=1` (one nearest neighbor) and makes predictions on the test set.

8. Evaluate Initial Model:
   
   from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

   print(confusion_matrix(ytest, ypred))
   print(classification_report(ytest, ypred))
  
   - Evaluates the model by printing the confusion matrix and classification report, which includes precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy.

9. Optimize K Value:
  
   error_rate = []

   for i in range(1, 40):
       knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)
       knn.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
       pred_i = knn.predict(xtest)
       error_rate.append(np.mean(pred_i != ytest))

   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.plot(range(1, 40), error_rate, color='blue', linestyle='--', markersize=10, markerfacecolor='red', marker='o')
   plt.title('K versus Error rate')
   plt.xlabel('K')
   plt.ylabel('Error rate')
  
   - Finds the optimal number of neighbors (`k`) by iterating over values from 1 to 39, training a KNN model for each `k`, and calculating the error rate. The error rate for each `k` is plotted to visualize the optimal `k`.

10. Retrain with Optimal K:
   
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=11)
    knn.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
    predictions = knn.predict(xtest)
    

11. Evaluate Optimized Model:
   
    print(confusion_matrix(ytest, predictions))
    print(classification_report(ytest, predictions))
  

12. Euclidean Distance Calculation Example:
  
    # Define a function to calculate Euclidean distance
    def euclidean_distance(a, b):
        return np.sqrt(np.sum((a - b) ** 2))

    # Taking example
    example_index = 0
    example = xtest[example_index]
    true_label = ytest.iloc[example_index]

    distances = np.array([euclidean_distance(example, x_train) for x_train in xtrain])

    # Find the k nearest neighbors
    nearest_neighbors_indices = distances.argsort()[:k_value]
    nearest_neighbors_labels = ytrain.iloc[nearest_neighbors_indices]

    # Determine the predicted label
    predicted_label = nearest_neighbors_labels.mode()[0]

    print(f'Test example: {example}')
    print(f'True label: {"has diabetes" if true_label == 1 else "does not have diabetes"}')
    print(f'Predicted label: {"has diabetes" if predicted_label == 1 else "does not have diabetes"}')
    print(f'Nearest neighbors labels: {nearest_neighbors_labels.values}')
    print(f'Distances to nearest neighbors: {distances[nearest_neighbors_indices]}')

    # Check if the prediction is correct
    if true_label == predicted_label:
        print("The prediction is correct.")
    else:
        print("The prediction is incorrect.")
 

    - Defines a function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.
    - Takes an example test data point, calculates distances to all training points, finds the `k` nearest neighbors, and predicts the label based on the mode of the nearest neighbors' labels.
    - Prints the test example, true label, predicted label, nearest neighbors' labels, distances, and checks if the prediction is correct.
